Draw a detailed schematic (by hand or computerized) of your hardware design for the [gp4 CLA module](hw2b.md). You don't need to draw a CLA schematic; the schematic in the lecture slides is pretty detailed already.

You should include signal names, module names, port names and bus widths. You can leave a module as a black box to simplify things, but then you should show elsewhere on the schematic what that black box does.

Simple modules (e.g., muxes and the SystemVerilog operators you are allowed to use) can be drawn as in the lecture slides or as a simple box with a label. They don't need further elaboration.

See also [the example schematic for Lab 1](../hw1/hw1-schematic.pdf).

When your schematic is complete, you can translate it directly into SystemVerilog. We encourage you to keep your schematic up-to-date as your design evolves.
